# The First Job Technical Test for Jr. Data Analyst Position

In this repository, I just want to share my experience analysed 2 business cases for jr. data analyst position at a financial start-up company. Here are some task details for each business case:

## Business Case 1: Improving Business Performance
I have to analyse what happened to the company business performance in the first quarter of 2021. After that, further solutions and recommendations are needed to improve the business during the Q1 of 2021. The solutions and recommendations can be found from the Q1 of 2021 business performance data analysis. Last but not least, I have to make recommendations for Q2 of 2021 to improve business performance in the future.

## Business Case 2:
I have to analyse what are the factors of happiness. In this case, I utilize data visualization techniques and some statistics to find relations between each variable that contribute to happiness.

P.S. I feel my data analysis still "shallow". So further improvements in my data analysis techniques are absolutely needed to make even more sharp analysis result.
